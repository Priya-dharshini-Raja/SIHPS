## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.
## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Environment

## Idea:
To locate the nearest e-waste facility depending on the user's current location with the
help of Geocoding API AI and image recognition to identify and categorize e-waste
when user takes photo to suggest appropriate recycling facility A virtual Assistant that
give recommendations on how to dispose of e-waste and proper ways for data wiping
for device with sensitive information depending on type of waste Educational pop-ups
that spread awareness of how harmful e-waste are to the environment and human
health Reward points can be earned for each e-waste disposal to encourage users A
dashboard for real-time analytics and insights for e-waste facilities that show users their
operations and statistics of recycling rates and energy savings
